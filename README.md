# theWaterlooGames
Final project for our CHE 120 programming course.

This game is a visual novel-style parody of the Hunger Games. The player is reaped from District 12, and is then set to compete against their 1A Chemical Engineering professors. Each battle with a professor is a battle of the wits- the player is asked a series of questions based on the professor's subject. 

Gameplay takes approximately 30 minutes.
